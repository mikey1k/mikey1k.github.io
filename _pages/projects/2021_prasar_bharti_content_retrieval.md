In this age of digitization and AI, machine learning technologies have opened up vast opportunities. A proper content analysis can help in efficient search, recommendation, accessibility, translation and so on. In this project, we propose to develop and deploy audio-based content retrieval technologies for Prasar Bharati's multimedia content. 

The overarching goal of this project is audio-based content retrieval. We will develop two kinds of retrieval methods, viz., extracting text labels from audio (audio tagging) and direct audio matching (audio fingerprinting).
